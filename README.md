# Anvik Labs

Portfolio and studio site for Anvik Labs, a product design and engineering studio. The site is a dark, type-led React Router application with a small set of editorial routes: home, selected work, project detail, journal, services, and contact.

## Stack

- React 19
- React Router 8 with Vite
- Tailwind CSS 4
- Framer Motion
- TypeScript

## Development

Requires Node.js 22 or newer.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Vite prints the local URL. Run the production build with:

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

## Checks

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm run build
```

Run all three before considering a change complete.

## Routes

| Route | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `/` | Home: introduction, Designers Room feature, team, services, testimonials, writing |
| `/works` | Selected work index |
| `/works/:slug` | Project case study |
| `/contact` | Inquiry details and contact form |
| `/journal` | Writing index |
| `/services/web-development` | Web development service |
| `/services/product-design` | UI/UX and product design service |
| `/services/ai-solutions` | AI solutions service |
| `/services/website-maintenance` | Website maintenance service |
| `/sitemap.xml` | Generated sitemap (static routes plus work case studies) |

Routes are declared in `src/routes.ts`. SEO metadata is centralised in `src/lib/site.ts`
(`createMeta()`, `createWorkDescription()`, and organisation config). `public/robots.txt`
and `public/llms.txt` are static; the sitemap is prerendered from `src/app/sitemap.ts`.

## Project structure

```text

  app/                 Route modules and global styles
  components/          Shared UI and home-page sections
  data/                Work and testimonial content
  lib/site.ts          Site metadata
  root.tsx             Document shell, fonts, skip link, hash scrolling
  routes.ts            React Router route config

  profile/             Team imagery
```

## Content

- Project data lives in `src/data/projects.json`, with typed accessors in `src/data/projects.ts`. Each project supplies its work type plus the design and/or development decisions shown on its dedicated case-study page.
- Testimonials live in `src/data/testimonials.json`. Author avatars are optional via an `avatar` field; entries without an image render a circular initials fallback.
- The contact form submits to FormSubmit (`https://formsubmit.co/ajax/anviklabs@gmail.com`), which forwards each inquiry to `anviklabs@gmail.com`. The first submission sends an activation email to that address; click its link once to start receiving messages. Submissions are not stored in this repo.
- Before launch, confirm that project names, case-study copy, mockups, and client quotes are approved for publication. Some current project content is portfolio placeholder material.

## Design and accessibility

- Global tokens and base styles are in `src/app/globals.css`.
- Keep the dark palette, restrained accent use, hairline rules, and editorial type hierarchy.
- Avoid decorative gradients, heavy shadows, oversized radii, and generic card grids.
- Use semantic landmarks, one `h1` per page, visible focus states, labelled form controls, and alt text for meaningful images.
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` for animated content.
- The current design system is documented in [`design.md`](./design.md).
- The frontend audit and its remaining risks are in [`docs/frontend-ai-slop-audit.md`](./docs/frontend-ai-slop-audit.md).

## Deployment

The app builds to `build/client` and can be deployed to any static host that supports React Router's SPA fallback. The build also prerenders repository routes. Set the host to serve `build/client` and fall back to `build/client/__spa-fallback.html` for unknown paths.
